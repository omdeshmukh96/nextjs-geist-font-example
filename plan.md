# NeiWorks – Civic Intelligence Platform Implementation Plan

This plan outlines a complete, production-ready, full-stack civic engagement platform with a modular monorepo structure that includes a React.js frontend (with Next.js), a Flutter mobile app, Node.js backend, AI microservices, dashboards, and deployment assets.

---

## 1. Folder Structure & Monorepo Setup

- **Create Folders:**
  - `/frontend` – React.js web application.
  - `/mobile` – Flutter mobile project.
  - `/backend` – Node.js + Express backend.
  - `/ai` – Contains subfolders: `nlp-service`, `cv-service`, `prioritization-service`, `chatbot-service`.
  - `/dashboards` – React-based admin/citizen/municipal dashboards.
  - `/deployment` – Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD scripts.
- **Monorepo Configuration:**
  - Update the root `package.json` to include a `"workspaces": ["frontend", "backend", "ai/**", "dashboards"]` property.
  - Ensure each module’s package.json lists its dependencies and scripts.

---

## 2. Frontend (React.js – Next.js)

- **Files to Modify/Create:**
  - **`/frontend/package.json`**: Add dependencies such as framer-motion, Firebase SDK, and Google Maps API integration libraries.
  - **`/frontend/next.config.ts`**: Add environment variable exposure for `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and Firebase credentials.
  - **`/frontend/src/app/globals.css`**:  
    - Update color palette using Blue (`#0052CC`), Green (`#00C853`), and Orange (`#FF6D00`).
    - Ensure high-contrast mode and ARIA-friendly component styling.
  - **New Components (in `/frontend/src/components`):**
    - **`ReportForm.tsx`**:  
      - A form with inputs for complaint description, geolocation (using browser geolocation API), multi-media file uploads (with file type and size validation), and auto-category suggestion (calls AI services).
      - Integrate service-worker logic for offline caching.
    - **`DashboardTimeline.tsx`**:  
      - Interactive timeline displaying complaint statuses (Reported → Acknowledged → Assigned → Resolved).  
      - Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
    - **`MapComponent.tsx`**:  
      - A modern map interface that leverages the Google Maps API (using the provided key) and renders geo-tagged complaint markers.
    - **`GamificationBadges.tsx`**:  
      - Displays badges, points, and leaderboard standings with clean typography and spacing.
    - **`LanguageSelector.tsx`**:  
      - Dropdown to switch between English, Hindi, and regional languages.
  - **Error Handling:**  
    - Include try/catch blocks and fallback UI states in each component.
    - Validate user inputs and file uploads before submission.

---

## 3. Backend (Node.js + Express)

- **Folder & File Structure:**
  - **`/backend/package.json`**:  
    - Include dependencies: express, pg, mongoose, redis, jsonwebtoken, and Sentry for logging.
  - **Main Entry (e.g., `index.js` or `app.js`):**  
    - Initialize Express, configure middleware, and load routes.
    - Integrate Sentry for error logging.
  - **`/backend/config/db.js`**:  
    - Establish PostgreSQL connection (for structured data) and MongoDB connection (for unstructured AI data); initialize Redis.
  - **Routes (in `/backend/routes`):**
    - `complaints.js`: CRUD endpoints for complaints; include duplicate detection by calling a utility.
    - `users.js`: Routes for registration, login, and role management using JWT + OAuth2.
    - `notifications.js`: Endpoints to trigger notifications (integrated with Firebase push using provided credentials).
    - `municipal.js`: APIs for municipal unit data.
  - **Controllers (in `/backend/controllers`):**  
    - Create dedicated controllers for complaints, users, notifications, and municipal functionalities.
  - **Middleware (in `/backend/middleware`):**  
    - `auth.js`: Validate JWT tokens and enforce role-based access.
    - `errorHandler.js`: Global error catcher returning proper statuses.
  - **Utilities:**  
    - `duplicateComplaintDetector.js`: Implement geolocation and text similarity checks.

## 4. AI Microservices

For each microservice, follow a similar structure with its own Express server and Dockerfile.

### A. NLP Service (`/ai/nlp-service`)
- **Files:**  
  - `package.json`, `index.js` (Express server), `routes/analyze.js`, `controllers/analyzeController.js`.
- **Features:**  
  - Accept complaint text and output category, sentiment, and severity.
  - Use the provided OpenAI API key via a REST call.
  - Validate input and handle API errors gracefully.

### B. Computer Vision Service (`/ai/cv-service`)
- **Files:**  
  - `package.json`, `index.js`, `routes/processImage.js`, `controllers/processImageController.js`.
- **Features:**  
  - Process image uploads detecting potholes, garbage, broken streetlights, and flooding.
  - Implement file validations and return severity tags.
  
### C. Prioritization Service (`/ai/prioritization-service`)
- **Files:**  
  - `package.json`, `index.js`, `routes/priority.js`, `controllers/priorityController.js`.
- **Features:**  
  - Accept complaint data and output a numerical urgency score based on historical trends.
  
### D. Chatbot Service (`/ai/chatbot-service`)
- **Files:**  
  - `package.json`, `index.js`, `routes/chat.js`, `controllers/chatController.js`.
- **Features:**  
  - Provide a multilingual conversational guide for complaint reporting and FAQs.
  - Use the provided OpenAI API key and follow a rigorous error check mechanism.

## 5. Dashboards

- **Folder:** `/dashboards`
- **Setup:**  
  - Create a React-based project (using Create React App or Next.js) in the dashboards folder.
  - **Pages to Implement:**
    - `citizenDashboard.tsx`: Complaint submission status, heatmaps, and gamification stats.
    - `authorityDashboard.tsx`: Complaint queue filtering (by category, severity, and location), real-time analytics (using Chart.js/Recharts), and predictive AI alerts.
    - `adminDashboard.tsx`: User/municipal management, KPI monitoring, and audit log views.
  - **UI Components:**  
    - Include interactive charts, maps (using Leaflet), and filtering controls.
    - Use modern typography, consistent spacing, and our branding colors.
  - **Error Handling:**  
    - Implement API call error boundaries and loading states.

## 6. Deployment & DevOps

- **Dockerization:**
  - Create Dockerfiles for each module:
    - `/deployment/frontend.Dockerfile`
    - `/deployment/backend.Dockerfile`
    - Dockerfiles in each subfolder of `/ai` (or a multi-stage Dockerfile)
    - `/deployment/dashboards.Dockerfile`
- **Kubernetes Manifests:**
  - Create YAML files in `/deployment/k8s/` for Deployments, Services, and Ingress configurations.
- **CI/CD:**
  - In the root, add a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml` to:
    - Lint, test, and build each workspace.
    - Deploy images to the cloud and update k8s manifests.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Configure Prometheus exporters in backend and AI services.
  - Deploy Grafana dashboards and integrate Sentry for error monitoring.
  - Write daily backup scripts and disaster recovery instructions in documentation.

---

## 7. Security, Compliance & Best Practices

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Enforce JWT + OAuth2 across backend endpoints.
  - Implement RBAC via middleware.
- **Data Protection:**
  - Utilize input sanitization and validation on both frontend and backend.
  - Encrypt sensitive data and maintain GDPR/India Data Protection standards.
- **Audit & Logging:**
  - Log all user and AI actions using middleware and store audit logs.
  - Ensure HTTPS is enforced in deployment configurations.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Use global error handlers, proper try/catch blocks and return informative error messages (without exposing sensitive details).

---

## 8. Testing & Documentation

- **Testing:**
  - Write unit/integration tests for frontend components using Jest/React Testing Library.
  - Backend and AI services to include tests with Mocha/Chai or Jest.
  - Validate critical endpoints using curl commands per our API testing guidelines.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` with setup instructions, API documentation, and deployment guidelines.
  - Inline code comments and migration documentation for DB changes.
